## Description of the Data
The proposed dashboard will visualize a dataset of approximately 10,000 boardgames published between 1950 and 2021. The dataset comes from the [Board Game Geek website](https://boardgamegeek.com/) and includes boardgames with descriptions, general game details, publisher, and user ratings. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mshepherd/board-games) and is regularly updated with the latest data.

Numerical game details include features such as min/max players and min/max/ave playing time, while categorical game details include features such as `category` and  `mechanic`. Note that the categorical features can have multiple values. For example, the `mechanic` feature for an individual boardgame may have both "Area Control" and "Area Influence" as values. The publishing information includes `year_published` and features for the `author`, `designer`, and `publisher`. The `publisher` feature is missing the least amount of values in the datasets compared with `author` and `designer`. The user rating features include the boardgame average user rating (`average_rating`) as well as the number of users that have provided a rating (`users_rated`).  There are currently no derived features anticipated for the dataset.
