# How to Contribute

We welcome all contributions to this project! If you notice a bug or have a feature request, please [open up an issue](https://github.com/ubco-mds-2020-labs/dashboard-project-group14/issues). All contributors must abide by our [code of conduct](https://github.com/ubco-mds-2020-labs/dashboard-project-group14/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/ubco-mds-2020-labs/dashboard-project-group14/pull/new/main) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
```
    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

Thanks,
