# Team Contract

## Goals

- Generate a dashboard meeting the project requirements and useable for portfolios.
- Learn how to create dashboards effectively.
- High grade.
- If one team member wants to do more work on a specific aspect of interest, that's ok.

## Meeting Norms

- Meetings will be figured out generally in advance based on discussing schedules.
- Generally plan to do any required collaborative work during the lab sessions.
- Meetings as required based on the work.
- Meeting action items will be noted using Github Issues.

## Work Norms

- Work will be divided based on team discussions, generally trying to split equal loads, and based on interest in tasks.
- Tasks will be recorded in Github Issues.
- If struggling with a task, provide lots of advance communication and the group will help sort it out.
- Work will be reviewed using Pull Requests and discussed/resolved using comments as well as in Slack.
- Work can be done as wanted by each member within the established deadlines. If one team members work is dependent on another, that should be discussed when setting deadlines.
- Lots of communication should be used.
- Expected hours are just based on completing the project to a high standard.

## Decision Making

- All major project direction decisions will be discussed and decided upon as a group.
- Minor decisions that need to be made for a task can be made (but if in doubt, ask the group) as work will be reviewed as part of a Pull Request.
- Any decision conflicts will be discussed/resolved in a group setting as required.
