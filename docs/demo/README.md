# 3D Game Explorer Demo

Here's a brief demo on using the 3D Game Explorer!

The demo shows the following:

- Selecting a game of interest (Catan in this case).
- Finding it is in the Negotiation category and filtering based on that selection.
- Exploring similar games in close proximity to Catan.
- Exploring another grouping of games within the Negotiation category which happens to be Monopoly games. The size of the many of these points are small which indicates these have low user ratings.
